    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 5, 2026</p>

    <p>Sayvo ("we", "our", or "the app") is a voice and text translation application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Sayvo is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal data necessary to provide translation services.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Audio data:</strong> Voice messages and audio files you share with or record in the app are sent to OpenAI API for transcription and translation. Audio is processed in real-time and is not stored on our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Text data:</strong> Text you enter for translation is sent to OpenAI API for processing and is not stored on our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Local data:</strong> Translation history, usage counters, and your language preferences are stored locally on your device only.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Sayvo uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> For audio transcription and text translation. Audio and text are sent to OpenAI servers for processing. Please refer to <a href="https://openai.com/privacy">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a> for details on how they handle data.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For managing in-app subscriptions. RevenueCat may collect anonymous purchase data. See <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> For processing payments. Payments are handled entirely by Apple.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All user data is stored locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Translation history is stored in a local database (SQLite)</li>
        <li>Usage limits and preferences are stored in local storage (SharedPreferences)</li>
        <li>No user data is stored on external servers operated by us</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>We do not use analytics or tracking services</li>
        <li>We do not collect device identifiers</li>
        <li>We do not share any data with advertisers</li>
        <li>We do not store your audio files or translations on our servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Microphone Access</h2>
    <p>Sayvo requests microphone access solely for the voice recording feature in the text translation screen. Microphone access is optional and the app functions without it. Audio recorded through the microphone is processed the same way as shared audio files — sent to OpenAI for transcription and not stored.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Sayvo is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>
